The lines below might hint at the cause of the crash. If you see question
marks as part of the stack trace, try to recompile with debugging information
enabled and export CLING_DEBUG=1 environment variable before running.
You may get help by asking at the ROOT forum https://root.cern/forum
preferably using the command (.forum bug) in the ROOT prompt.
Only if you are really convinced it is a bug in ROOT then please submit a
report at https://root.cern/bugs or (preferably) using the command (.gh bug) in
the ROOT prompt. Please post the ENTIRE stack trace
from above as an attachment in addition to anything else
that might help us fixing this issue.
